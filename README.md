The photos from your iPhone will be shown in the left-hand pane of the program, while all the pictures and folders on your computer will be displayed on the right side.

Now you can select some of your images or all of them at once (by pressing the ctrl and “A” keys simultaneously) as well as all your photo albums, and copy photos from iPhone to PC with a simple drag-and-drop.

Finally, click the green “Apply” button and you’re all set!
